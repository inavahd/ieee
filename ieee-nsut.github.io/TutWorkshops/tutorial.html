<p>The smart electric utility is evolving dynamically as a result of technological advances, encouraging energy markets and policy changes which boost the renewable energy penetration several folds. Simultaneously it imposes serious challenges on one of the major component i.e. the grid tied inverter such that its control undergoes a metamorphosis.&nbsp; The development of advanced functionalities for inverters can make these smart and future ready. This tutorial aims at a deliberation on such advanced functionalities of grid tied inverters to prepare these to operate in the future energy systems which will be inverter dominated grids with high renewable energy penetration. The advanced inverter functions considered includes: (i) Capability of “riding through” minor disturbances in frequency or voltage, (ii) Capability to inject or absorb electricity into or from the grid, (iii) Capability for soft start after power outages, (iv) Controlled active power ramping for grid stability (v) Islanding detection and grid forming, (vi) seamless transfer between grid tied to grid forming modes, and, (vii) Dynamic reactive power control. Besides these, recent advancements in regular inverter functions like grid synchronization, power regulation with non-linear control etc. also will be dealt in the tutorial.</p>

<p>This talk will focus on the recently developed neural network learning algorithms inspired from the models of human meta-cognition. Meta-cognition is defined as knowledge about knowledge. In this talk, we present the recently developed Meta-cognitive Radial Basis Function (McRBF) neural network that uses the concepts from the areas of psychology of human learning. McRBF also has a cognitive and a meta-cognitive component. An RBF neural network that is able to represent knowledge is the cognitive component, and a self-regulatory learning mechanism is its meta-cognitive component. For every sample instance in the training set, the self-regulatory learning mechanism compares the knowledge represented by the cognitive component with that of the sample instance. Based on its judgment, it chooses suitable learning strategies, and decides that-to-learn, when-to-learn and how-to-learn in a meta-cognitive environment. As the McRBF self-regulates its own learning process, it has better generalization abilities. The decision making abilities of McRBF are demonstrated using standard benchmark classification problems and also with some real applications in the areas of medical informatics problems specifically in detecting Alzheimer’s Disease (AD ) from brain MRI images.</p>

<p>Segmentation of brain Magnetic Resonance (MR) image data has a significant impact on the computer guided medical image diagnosis and analysis. However, due to limitations of image acquisition devices and other related factors, MR images are severely affected by the noise and inhomogeneity artefacts which lead to blurry edges in the intersection of the intra-organ soft tissue regions, making the segmentation process more difficult and challenging. Among the different image segmentation techniques devised in the past for medical images, the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm has proved its efficacy. In this tutorial, FCM algorithm will be discussed in details for medical image segmentation, especially for brain MR images. Its limitations are also be highlighted. Different new variations of FCM algorithm will be discussed to address the limitations of FCM algorithm and also challenges in segmenting brain MR images.</p>

<p>Minimizing power dissipation during the VLSI design flow increases reliability and lifespan of the circuit. Though numerous techniques are in place for successfully reducing the circuit power dissipation during functional operation, testing of such low power circuits have recently become an area of concern. Researches show that a VLSI chip can dissipate up to three times higher power during testing when compared to functional operation. Traditional DFT methodologies are not valid and lead to low circuit reliability and reduced manufacturing yield. Therefore, addressing the problems associated with testing of low power circuits have become an important issue. This tutorial will discuss the different methods used for Low Power Testing.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. S. Krishna Kumar</strong> did his B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the T.K.M. College of Engineering, Kollam and M.Tech in Computer Science from IIT Madras. His doctoral research at IIT Kharagpur was in the area of Power Aware and Thermal Aware Testing. He served at the the Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore, for 17 years as a member of the faculty in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Since 2013, he is a Professor in ECE, at the Federal Institute of Science and Technology (FISAT), Kochi. His research interests include Digital VLSI, VLSI CAD, Digital Architecture and Embedded Systems.</p>
